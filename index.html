											<h3>Naira scarcity: Atiku, Obi hypocrites — Remi Omowaye</h3>
											<h4>feb 14</h4>
											<p>Both presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and of the Labour Party, Peter Obi have been described as hypocrites for supporting the naira redesign policy of the federal government.

												The spokesperson of the Tinubu-Shettima presidential campaign committee in Osun state, Engineer Remi Omowaye disclosed this in an interview with Sunday Vanguard in Osogbo.
												
												
												“For anyone to support that policy on the excuse of vote buying amounts to speaking from both sides of the mouth. Peter Obi’s team even yesterday urged FG not to extend the deadline in the face of a Supreme Court order, yet, the same team talked about rule of law and love for the masses.
												
												“If their target is our campaign team, we still have masses thronging to everywhere our candidate, Bola Tinubu goes, the crowd in Oyo state on Thursday was massive ditto for Borno State.
												
												“Both Atiku and Obi should consider the plights of the common man who is at the receiving end of the policy. Who queue up in banks for several our and go home with nothing. Who wants to pay for the hospital bill and his efforts end in vain? The common man is our major concern, he is the reason we are against the policy implementation”, he added.

												Under-fire Chelsea boss, Graham Potter, suffered another blow as bottom of the table Southampton won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.
												
												James Ward-Prowse scored his 17th Premier League free-kick — one behind David Beckham’s record in the competition — to give Southampton the lead in first half stoppage-time.
												
												
												Stuart Armstrong was fouled on the edge of the area and with Saints fans chanting Ward-Prowse’s name, the midfielder curled a superb set-piece past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
												
												Chelsea were booed off at full-time after a result that left them languishing in 10th place, with just two wins in their last 14 games in all competitions and none in their last five.
